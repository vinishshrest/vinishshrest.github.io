excerpt: 'We develop an overlapping generations model with labor supply, health risk, and health insurance choice to evaluate the effects of imposing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. The model is calibrated to U.S. data and used to simulate counterfactual policies that condition Medicaid access on minimum weekly work hours, with exemptions for the sick and disabled.'
