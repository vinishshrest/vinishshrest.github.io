excerpt: 'We estimate the impact of increases in schools constructed from 1985 to 1995 on girls educational outcomes in Nepal. Our results indicate that the construction of an additional school (per 1,000 square kilometers) increased the probability to read and write among females by 1.5 percentage points and increased their highest level of schooling attained by 0.12 units but did not affect basic literacy skills among males.'
