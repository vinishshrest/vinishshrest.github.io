excerpt: 'The study examines how beer taxes affect retail beer prices. The findings show that a 10-cent increase in state beer taxes raises retail prices by about 17 cents, while a similar increase in federal beer taxes results in a 19-22 cent rise in retail prices. This indicates that consumers fully bear the burden of increased beer taxes.'
