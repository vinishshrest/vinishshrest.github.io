excerpt: 'This project examines the effectiveness of subsidization and group discussion interventions in increasing the demand for sanitary pads in Nepal. The study uses a field experiment where discount coupons of varying values were randomly assigned to participants, creating exogenous price variations. Additionally, some women participated in group discussions on menstrual health. The results showed that higher subsidies increased adoption rates, especially among women involved in the discussions, highlighting that combining financial incentives with social interventions can effectively mitigate the impact of societal stigma on health-related product adoption'
