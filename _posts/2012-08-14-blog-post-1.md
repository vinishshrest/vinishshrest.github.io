While parallel programming in R, the fork version is only compatible with Linux OS and not Windows (not to my knowledge). To do so, we will be 
using Ubuntu OS and will be implementing a function called mclapply, which is a spiffed up version of lapply, compatible with computations across 
more than one core.

Lets go over some ways that we can conduct repetition in R. 

First, we will use a dataframe iris embedded in R to select 10000 samples with replacement. Then calculate means for each sample, after which we will be performing 
regressions based on each of the sample.
